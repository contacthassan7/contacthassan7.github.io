      <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. How you weighed up and the consequences of the action you took</h2>
      <p> 
      Last month, I signed up on Delivereasy network to do the deliveries during evenings. There was one instance where I received a call right after I ended my shift. The support guy was asking me whether 
      the food I delivered to the right address. Somehow, my mind was playing jedi tricks to me and I was of the view that I have delivered the food to the right address but before I say something I asked 
      to give me few minutes to get back. I then googled the address right away and found out I delivered the food to the next door. I then call back and offered to pick-up and do the free food delivery to 
      that address. It turns out the area lead already knew that. And were thanking me to be honest. That was a <b>WOW</b> moment for me. </p>

      <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h2>
      <p> I came from a culture where religious has an important role to play. I’m proud of that. I carry the value of being honest and upfront. Truth always prevails. 
        I carry the value of giving; whether it’s helping others or giving <b><em>“Zakat”</em></b>. Helping others is actually helping yourself and giving <b><em>“Zakat”(donation)</em></b>  of what little I have gives me joy and 
        satisfaction.

        <h2>My strengths</h2>
        <p> I am a good problem solver, had learn this skill from experience. The magic which always works for me is to do proper research and analysis and then do the reverse engineering to crack the code. 
          The only limitation to this, it sometimes takes extra time to understand and experimentation which leads to mental exhaustion, if I’m not keeping time in check. </p>
          <p>My previous experience involved a lot of strategic planning, and it also became one of my core strengths. I use <b>MoSCoW</b> technique to keep myself aligned and focused. The limitation to this is if I 
          focused too much, then I can’t give myself a chance for error, which is in-fact a fast way of learning to write a good code.

          <h2>Facing resistance</h2>
          <p> I figured the resistance is everywhere. I wish it would be easy to deal with. Putting a Product Manager hat is not easy, and it requires a lot I mean <b>A LOT</b> of collaboration and influence to get 
            the work done. And influence takes time which is not an easy buy-in. </p>
            <p>I have faced resistance from putting up new ideas to making decisions which were quite simple. Sometimes I got successful and most of the time I got failed. I tried to overcome resistance by 
            speaking upfront, precise, and clear in my plans. And hold workshops for all stakeholders for collaboration. 
            Now, this technique is very much effective in agile environments where teamwork and collaboration is core to the working culture but not in waterfall where there is a set of hierarchy and stakeholders
            don’t buy-in to your plans that easily. They normally have their own set of agendas.
