      <h1>
        Core Reflection
      </h1>

      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h3> 
        <p>First, I always consider life is a great big adventure filled with experiences. And it shows that failure is a 
          part of our journey. Challenges and mistakes will help me learn. Throughout the foundations, I have growth mindset
           which enables me to stay positive and embrace new learnings. Secondly, higher EQ is essential and key to happiness
            for me. Modern day work is all about team collaboration. And this is where EQ plays very important role. I’m working 
            on it and now very much awareness of my emotions. Third, I learned that for problem solving pseudo coding plays very
            important role. It expedites the problem solving process and ensure I understand the problem right.
        </p> 
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h3> 
        <p>All these three elements play very important role. Value is who you are, what you stand for. Nobody is perfect so 
          empathy gives better understanding of all colleagues I’ll be working with. While self-awareness, helps very much 
          in understand yourself and recognizing the emotions going though. It gives a good check on mental health especially
          when doing the programming. 
        </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3> 
        <p>
          For me learning on neuroplasticity was very surprising. I didn’t know that before. The principles of neuroplasticity
          were an opener for me. After that I think I can learn anything. 
        </p>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3> 
        <p>
          For me as a new coder, decipher the query/problem was the most challenging. 
        </p>
      <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
        bootcamp course? 
      </h3> 
        <p>
          To my understanding, coding is essential, but doing it all alone will not take me anywhere. Core learning plays very 
          important role and I feel lucky to have been introduced to such concepts. I think Dev Academy spending so much time 
          focusing on core learning is for a reason which is to explore ourselves, aware of our situation, emotions and have a 
          check on our mental health. It also help us understanding others and in practical life it’s very much important.  IT 
          environment operates in Agile fashion and a key to success in Agile environment is collaboration and understanding each other.

          Learning Plan
      </h1>

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to start a business and get my own web development related projects. And for that I’ll gain experience
            first by getting into the market and sharpen my skills and build industry contacts. At the same time, I also would like to
            contribute to the community and I’m thinking either to do so by teaching voluntarily or pick up web development related
            project in Aotearoa.  
          </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>
            My biggest strength would be my family, the way they all are supporting right now. I think mindfulness is also my biggest 
            strength, this keeps anxiety at bay. I have discovered the rubber duck method works so well for me. My limitation is time 
            and less clear guidelines. Mental exhaustion comes very easily in this part of life. I am slow to begin with, takes time to
            get understanding and experimentation. 
          </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p>
            Cover all the material in time and doing enough exercises to feel confident and comfortable would remain a challenge. 
          </p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>
            I would like to develop communication and self-awareness skills. I would also like to work on collaboration part. 
            I think collaboration is very essence to fast track the learning. I’m looking forward building that.
          </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            I would like to have support from the team where I’m stuck in a problem or when going tangent. On the other hand, 
            checking on mental health is a must. I would expect the same as facilitators did in foundations. 
          </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            I will be taking regular breaks. Sometimes changing the environment works really well for me. I would also work on 
            my communication with all in Bootcamp. This is the key. 
          </p>

    <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2> 
    <p > Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, 
      use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize 
      with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger 
      relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help 
      you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what 
      matters most to you. Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Self-management</b> You’re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</li>
        <li><b>Self-awareness</b> You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.</li>
        <li><b>Social awareness</b> You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.</li>
        <li><b>Relationship management</b> You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.</li>
    
    <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>IQ represents abilities such as:</p>
      <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
      <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
      <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
      <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
      <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
    
    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>Both are equally important and I think IQ defines the ability to solve the problems and EQ defines 
      that ability to handle emotions and channelize them for ones good. Like ability to work under stress. 
      We all know stress or danger kills creativity or problem solving, on a physical level this happens 
      because of the chemicals produced in human body under stress or danger. The reasoning and creative 
      parts of brain require a lot of energy from the body; in order to cater a dangerous situation body 
      shifts the energy focus from brain to muscles, which gets humans into a fight or flight mode. EQ education 
      helps humans to keep the logical thinking alive during those emotional outbursts of happiness or fear.</p>
    
    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, border and padding?</h2>
    <p>Margin is the starting point of the element, it changes the placement of the element on the page. Margins are used to add spaces between an image and the description of that image.</p>
    <p>Border is outline of the element, could be as big as a page itself or as little as a button</p>
    <img src="images/borderandpadding.png" alt="image loading" style="width:25%; height:25%;  margin-right:5px;">
    <p>Padding is the distance between the border of the element and its content, below is the example of padding CSS Padding is used if we want to create a space between an element and the 
    edge of the container or the border. It is also useful in the requirement of changing the size of the element.</p>
