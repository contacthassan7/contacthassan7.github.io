    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      I’m from Product Management background. And has always been curious about web development. I have chosen this Bootcamp to learn basic 
      set of skills first to qualify for entry level roles as a Web Developer. After learning the basics, I would like to explore more.

      <h2>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning

        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <h3>My strengths </h3>
        <p>
          <li>I am a good problem solver, had learn this skill from experience. </li>
          <li>I am good at planning and prioritization; however, it’s not reflecting at the moment in first 3 sprints. </li>
          <li>Once, I take up the task I feel responsible for that and goes to extra length to deliver that. </li>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>
          <li>I am slow to begin with, takes time to get understanding and experimentation. </li>
          <li>Mental exhaustion comes very easily in this part of life where I’m also managing 2 kids. </li>
          <li>Time is a rare commodity for me, in this part of life. I’m working very hard on that. </li>
          </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Non-technical - human skills would you like to see developed</h2>
        <p>I’m a firm believer of synergy. And have a feeling that coding is not something to be done in silos. I would like to work on
          collaboration part. I think collaboration is very essence to fast track the learning. I’m looking forward building that. </p>

    <div class="aboutme-div"> 
      <h2>Managing Workload </h2>
        <p>
          My strategy is to eliminate all the noise and distraction around me. I do this by putting on ear buds and listening to 
          white noise. It helps me focus. And the other technique I’m using is Pomodoro to hit my goals. Each Pomodoro session goes 
          for 40 min. and then I take 5 min. break to stretch. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When things started to pile up. I do change the environment and it helps. Finding right balance between work, planning 
          and health is not easy and it takes time. I am still adapting and break down tasks further into miniscule goals, so I know 
          I’m hitting the goal. And keep myself motivated. 
          <h2>How and where you will seek help in a timely way </h2>
        <p>I am bit of old school guy who sat in classes and seek help right away with friends, colleagues, and teachers in class. 
        Online learning is way different and I’m adapting myself to this environment. Currently, Google and W3school is where I 
        get most of the help. But it has a drawback. One can easily goes down the rabbit hole. Which I’m experiencing. </p>
        <p>A note to self: Get in touch with your cohort colleagues and facilitators more often, when stuck. </p>

        <h2>Expectation from the facilitation team</h2>
          <p>
            A hand holding through this cohort, a little bit of encouragement, monitor my learning curve and feedback on that. </p>
            <h2>Block-out times when you are committed to other things. </h2>
            <p>Family commitments in morning and evenings. Nothing else. </p>
