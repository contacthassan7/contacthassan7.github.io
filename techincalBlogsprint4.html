    <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
    <p>Since this course started, I get stuck so many times again and again even did 
      repetitive mistakes. But the real question is how to get unstuck. I’ve had a fair 
      share of moments when I think I’ll nail this task] and I started to write the code 
      somehow stuck in between.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With sprint 4 I can give an example of FizzBuzz challenge. It is quiet 
      a unique challenge in itself. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It requires to write a code which says if a number is a multiple of 3 it says 
      Fizz and if a number is a multiple of 5 it says Buzz and if the number is a 
      multiple of 3 and 5 = 15 it should say FizzBuzz. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Now I tried to pseudo code on paper first and it seems very easy and my approach 
    was straight forward, use if else statement and nail the solution. The solution 
    looks like this 
      <ul>
        // if number is divisible by 3 then return fizz 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        //else if number is divisible by 5 then return buzz 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        //else if number is divisible by 3 && 5 then return fizzbuzz 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        //else return the number 
      </ul>
      </p>
    
    <p>

      So, fizz and buzz were displaying but FizzBuzz was not displaying at all. 
      I fell into the hole of searching and google makes sure when you are puzzled 
      you never get the right answer. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      By this time, I tried pseudo code it helps writing down my approach but
       what to do when I’m stuck. Then I tried rubber duck method, list down 
       the question and took the shower and then tried to explain the question 
       to tissue roll. And I still didn’t get it, seriously. Then I looked into
        sample solutions and from there I got the idea on changing the position 
        of ‘if’ statement and now whole equation makes sense. And the code is 
        running like a charm.  
    </p>


    <p>

      I learned, sometimes you didn’t get the answer easily. And what appears 
      simple might not be. But changing the environment and going through problem 
      solving techniques equips you with a lot of more knowledge. And you will 
      eventually get there.

    <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving 
      techniques/processes:</h2>
    
      <ul><b>Pseudo: </b>it helps laying down my approach to tackle the problem </ul>
      <ul><b>Trying something:</b> I keep on trying if something doesn’t work</ul>
      <ul><b>Rubber ducky method:</b>the best method so far gives confidence and 
        test my understanding</ul>
      <ul><b>Reading error messages:</b> it helps to identify error on which line
         and its nature </ul>
      <ul><b>Console.logging:</b> my best friend which makes sure I’m doing right/ 
        wrong</ul>
      <ul><b>Googling:</b> sometimes helpful sometime puzzling </ul>
      <ul><b>Asking your peers for help:</b> Haven’t relied on it, still I do think 
        I utilize this more during classes sessions  </ul>
      <ul><b>Asking coaches for help:</b> I take this as a matter of last resort when 
        nothing works </ul>
      <ul><b>Improving your process with reflection: </b>I like this process the most.
        It is enlightening me and reading my journey through this course is a good
        booster for me. </ul>
