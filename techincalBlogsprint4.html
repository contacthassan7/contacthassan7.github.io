     <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2> 
    <p > Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, 
      use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize 
      with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger 
      relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help 
      you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what 
      matters most to you. Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Self-management</b> Youâ€™re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</li>
        <li><b>Self-awareness</b> You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.</li>
        <li><b>Social awareness</b> You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.</li>
        <li><b>Relationship management</b> You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.</li>
    
    <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>IQ represents abilities such as:</p>
      <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
      <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
      <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
      <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
      <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
    
    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>Both are equally important and I think IQ defines the ability to solve the problems and EQ defines 
      that ability to handle emotions and channelize them for ones good. Like ability to work under stress. 
      We all know stress or danger kills creativity or problem solving, on a physical level this happens 
      because of the chemicals produced in human body under stress or danger. The reasoning and creative 
      parts of brain require a lot of energy from the body; in order to cater a dangerous situation body 
      shifts the energy focus from brain to muscles, which gets humans into a fight or flight mode. EQ education 
      helps humans to keep the logical thinking alive during those emotional outbursts of happiness or fear.</p>
