  <h2>Neuroplasticity </h2> 
  
    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of 
  neuroplasticity benefits people
    </h3>
  
    <p > It is the ability of the brain to change, adapt, and modify 
    both structure and function over time in response to experience. 
    So, whatever the experience is; good or bad, our brain is making 
    a new neural connection. By learning something new, the neurons 
    create more connections between them. More connections mean the 
    neurons can send and receive more messages, thus stretching a part 
    of the brain. This makes the brain more elastic so that it can 
    hold more information.
    </p> 

    <p>
      Just like a dough which in start is quiet rigid and once we start
       kneading the dough it becomes more elastic and then we can mould
      it in any shape we like. Our brain is like a dough too which is
      experience driven and learning is a key. As per Donald Hebb 
      ‘Neurons that fire together, wire together.’ While, Kleim Jones
      said there are 10 main principles: 
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, this will benefits people a lot. Experiences can enhance 
      performance and by doing the repetition people can make their 
      brain more elastic. Hence, firing more neurons together. 
    </p>

    <h3>
      Discuss how you might engage with the principles of 
      neuroplasticity for your own benefit
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>Repetition Matters: </b> I can take this as one of my golden
       rule. To do the code everyday. It will help me in crafting my 
       skill. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Intensity Matters:  </b> To make my brain more elastic so it 
      absorbs more information. And more likely to achieve results. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Use it and Improve it:  </b> In recent past I experience 
      Sesamoiditis pain. I recently learned that I have to do some 
      stretch exercise of Plantar fascia muscles in order to improve
       the pain. Sometime weaker muscles lead to the injury. Well, 
       I’m recovered now. And I take this learning along that by doing
        continuous learning I can improve with time. 
    </p>

    <h3>
      What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I will be doing the physical exercise especially hot yoga which
       is more involved in stretching and helps increasing blood flow 
       to the brain. And to keep my brain function properly I’m making
        sure that I keep drinking plenty of water. Also making sure 
        that my brain gets all the necessary vitamins to function 
        properly. And it’s a blueberry season. I’ll be eating blueberries
         which is considered antioxidant superfood. Helps regulate eye 
         health and blood sugar.

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2> 

    <h3>
      Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
    </h3>

    <p>
      The way we see the world around us and how we behave towards
       life is called our mindset. We can choose to have a fixed 
       mindset, or to have a growth mindset. When we have a fixed 
       mindset things get too hard. Negative thoughts creep and we
        start to give up easily. Like it’s hard, I can’t do this, 
        and we may come up with many other excuses. 
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we can always have an option to choose growth mindset. 
    </p>

      <p>
        It helps us believe that the goals are within reach with 
        effort and consistency. Life is a great big adventure filled
         with experiences. And it shows that failure is a part of our
          journey. And the obstacles we encounter will only make us 
          stronger. Challenges and mistakes will help me learn. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I learnt that perfection does not exist and aiming for perfection
         is like running a race without a finishing line. It only leads 
         to exhaustion. 
      </p>

      <h3>
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </h3>

      <p>
        It doesn’t surprise me when I read about growth mindset. Putting 
        effort is the way to achieve your goal. But Neuroplasticity was 
        a new concept for me, and now I connect the dot with growth 
        mindset which is exactly what neuroplasticity tells us. These 
        two concepts really get along with each other. I’m taking 10 
        golden rules with me here. 
      </p>

      <h3>
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h3>

        <p>
          <li>
            Fear is the natural emotion we all experience it. And it can
            make changing our mindset difficult. The important thing is
             to try. 
          </li>

          <li>
            See challenges as adventures. They will make me more 
            resilient and open new world.  
          </li>

          <li>
            If I work hard, I will see progress.  
          </li>

          <li>
            Don’t worry about mistake they are part of life. 
          </li>

          <li>
            The good news is the sun always comes out after a storm. 
          </li>

          <li>
            By having a growth mindset, I might even find that a little 
            rain won’t bother much at all.  
          </li>
