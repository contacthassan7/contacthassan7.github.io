  <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2> 
  <p > Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to recognize, use, and control one's own emotions in a constructive way in order to 
    reduce stress, communicate effectively, sympathize with others, overcome obstacles, and diffuse conflict. It 
    helps in the development of stronger relationships, academic and professional success. It also helps in connecting with 
    your emotions, putting intentions into action, and making informed decisions on what is most important to you. 
    
    <p>Emotional intelligence is something that can be learnt and cultivated, not something that is fixed or innate, however 
    some people may find it easier due to their upbringing or experience. And having a high level of Emotional Intelligence improves 
    your ability to empathise and relate to others.</p>

    Four characteristics are used to characterize emotional intelligence are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Self-management</b> You can regulate your emotions in a healthy way, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and 
        adjust to changing situations.</li>
      <li><b>Self-awareness</b>  You're aware of your own feelings and how they influence your thoughts and actions. You are aware of 
        your talents and flaws and are self-assured.</li>
      <li><b>Social awareness</b>You're empathetic. You are aware of the feelings, needs, and concerns of others.</li>
      <li><b>Relationship management</b> You understand how to build and maintain positive relationships, communicate 
        effectively, inspire and influence others, collaborate effectively, and resolve disputes.</li>

    <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
  <p>EQ is very different than IQ. Below are the few points to tell the difference: </p>
    <li>EQ is the ability to recognize emotions while IQ is a person’s reasoning ability. </li>
    <li>You can improve your EQ while IQ is something you are born with. </li>
    <li>A person with high EQ can control and access emotions while a person with high IQ can swiftly 
      understand the logical reasoning and solve complex problems. </li>
    <li>A person’s success in school depends on his IQ level, whereas a person’s EQ level reflects his success in real life.</li>
    <li>A person's IQ level determines his academic performance, whereas his EQ level reflects his real-life success. </li>

  <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
  <p>Both are important. But we’ve learnt that IQ is something you are born with. And EQ is something you can improve. 
    Now, relating EQ to our work, home and social environments. I’m of the view that higher EQ is much needed. Modern day 
    work is all about team collaboration. Word ‘Team player’ on job description/CV sounds catching but at the same time a 
    lot of people are struggling. </p>
  
    <p>
      With higher EQ we can manage stress, resolve conflicts, manage workload and build better long-lasting relations. 
      A key to the happiness.
