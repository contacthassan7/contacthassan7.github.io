    <h2>
    JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
  </h2>
    
  <p>HTML provides structure to the webpage and its contents. 
    CSS does the styling and JavaScript does the automation.
    </p> 
   
    <p>In lay man terms, think of a human. HTML is the skeleton, 
      CSS is all the muscles and features like nose, ears, eyes etc. 
      While Javascript is the neural system which interacts with 
      every part of the body. 
    </p>
  
  <h2>
    Control flow and loops, arrays and objects
  </h2>
    <p>
      By default, JS code is executed from top to bottom, line by line, 
      however we can change this with Control flow. Control flow in JS 
      allows program to make decisions about what code is executed and 
      when.   
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      We humans use it every day in making and altering decisions. 
      A popular example is when we go out to buy groceries. We make 
      the list first check we got the wallet if yes then get into 
      the car if no then get the wallet first. If we don’t find our 
      listed item in store else we get an alternate. 
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Objects are obvious. For example A car television, menu etc. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Arrays is a collection of multiple values stored in a single variable. 
    In other words array is a list of objects. 
     For example, A list of to do, a shopping list, registers, menu etc 
  </p>

    <h2>
    Functions and why they are useful
    </h2>
  <p>
    These are the tasks defined by a set of instructions by us that can 
    be run at the certain point in time and are adaptable. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, I have a friend come over and request to have a cup 
    of coffee but he wants his coffee to be slightly different like 
    extra sugar and milk. It goes like: 
  </p>

    <ul>
      function makeCoffee (sugar, milk) { 
    </ul>

    <ul>
      let instructions = ‘Boil Water’  
    </ul>
    <ul>
      instructions = ‘pour into cup’
    </ul>
    <ul>
      instructions = ‘add coffee’ 
    </ul>

    <ul>
      instructions = ‘add’ + sugar + “spoons of sugar’  
    </ul>

    <ul>
      instructions = ‘add’ + milk + ‘% milk’ 
    </ul>
      
    <ul>
      return instructions     
    </ul>

    <ul>
    }
    </ul>


<h2>
    The DOM and DevTools
  </h2>
      
  <p>
    DOM represents the context of document as tree structure and we 
    use it to attach listeners, add, remove and change elements in 
    HTML document. While DevTools allows us to view and change/manipulate
     the DOM, change a page CSS in a preview environment and run JS code 
     in the console for testing. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For example: You might have observed this, every grocery store has 
    set number of aisles and each aisle represents various sections and 
    each section contains products which are similar. Just like a tree
    has a trunk which has many branches and each branch have flowers,
    fruits, and leaves.
