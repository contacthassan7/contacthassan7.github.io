    <h2>
    JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
  </h2>
    
  <p>HTML provides structure to the webpage and its contents. 
    CSS does the styling and JavaScript does the automation.
    </p> 
   
    <p>In lay man terms, think of a human. HTML is the skeleton, 
      CSS is all the muscles and features like nose, ears, eyes etc. 
      While Javascript is the neural system which interacts with 
      every part of the body.

  <h2>
    Control flow and loops
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Control flow 
  </h3>

  <p>
    In programming language, control flow refers to the sequence in which 
    function calls, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluated. 
    An if/else statement in the JavaScript is an example of a control flow statement.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For example:</b> Book issuance from library 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      <b>If</b> the book that I am searching for is not available in the library, then I 
      should be notified that the book is not avaliable <b>else</b> I get the location of the 
      book. 
    </p>

    <h3>
      Loops 
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Loops are used when you have to repeat the actions over and over again. Common life example is chopping veges. 
      Imagine we have a big pile of veges to chop and we are doing the same action over and over again. In the world 
      of loops we can put the repetitive stuff with in the loop. The loops need to have a starting point and a condition 
      when to terminate and an increment value that helps identify how many iterations are needed between the start value 
      and the end condition. The condition of the loop needs to be true on each iteration otherwise the loop will end. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      The increment expression tells us how big the loop hop will be. I don’t know if loop hop is even a term but this is 
      how I understand it. Kind of like a step or a hop from one iteration to the next.

    <h2>
      Arrays and Objects
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      <h3>Arrays:</h3> 
      In JavaScript, Array is an object which stores a list of values. 
      And sometimes we might be dealing with a list of objects for example list 
      of products in a shopping cart or the list of colors that the user has 
      selected. In situations like that, you use an array to store that list. 
      Array’s syntax structure would look like this: const arrayName = [item1, item2, ...] 
      and example would be: 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>let shoppingList = [‘eggs, ‘bread’, ‘apples’]</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Arrays is a collection of multiple values stored in a single variable. 
    In other words array is a list of objects. 
     For example, A list of to do, a shopping list, registers, menu etc 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In array each element is indexed that determines the position of an 
      element and index starts from zero. So, if we want to access an element 
      in an array, we use index. Here’s how: 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>console.log(shoppingList[2]) </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Result in console: <b>apples</b> 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <h3>Objects:</h3>
    Object can be a combination of data structures and variables. They can have 
    multiple attributes in the form on key value pairs. Each attribute has a unique 
    name (key) with-in the object and can be accessed by object[key]. We can also 
    assign the values to the attributes within the objects. From my experiment with 
    objects I found that the only part we can manipulate are the values; not keys.
    We cannot change structure of object from outside the object definition, like 
    adding more attributes to the object. <b>object[key]=’new_value’</b> will assign ‘new_value’ 
    to my objects’s key value. 
  </p>

  <p>The most common example I read that helps in explaining the concept of objects is </p>

    <h2>
    Functions and why they are useful
    </h2>
  <p>
    These are the tasks defined by a set of instructions by us that can 
    be run at the certain point in time and are adaptable. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, I have a friend come over and request to have a cup 
    of coffee but he wants his coffee to be slightly different like 
    extra sugar and milk. It goes like: 
  </p>

<h2>
    The DOM and DevTools
  </h2>
      
  <p>
    DOM represents the context of document as tree structure and we 
    use it to attach listeners, add, remove and change elements in 
    HTML document. While DevTools allows us to view and change/manipulate
     the DOM, change a page CSS in a preview environment and run JS code 
     in the console for testing. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For example: You might have observed this, every grocery store has 
    set number of aisles and each aisle represents various sections and 
    each section contains products which are similar. Just like a tree
    has a trunk which has many branches and each branch have flowers,
    fruits, and leaves.
